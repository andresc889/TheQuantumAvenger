# The Quantum Avenger

This was my final project for my Object Oriented Programming class. It's a game developed in Java. I had many final projects during my undergraduate studies, but I am particularly proud of this one due to the amount of effort that I put into it and the quality of the final result given the short amount of time I had to complete it. The main idea of the game is quite basic. A ship must shoot and destroy objects. I enhance this idea by providing attractive graphics and, most importantly, simulation of some physical laws.

The Quantum Avenger should compile on Java SE Development Kit 7 or higher. To compile, change your working directory to where the .java files are located.

The game requires the Vecmath package to compile (not included). If you have a JAR version of this package (see instructions below), you can compile the game using

`javac -cp vecmath-1.5.2.jar;. Main.java`

This assumes that vecmath-1.5.2.jar is in the current working folder. In a UNIX-based system, you may need to change the semicolon to a colon

To run the compiled file, use

`java -cp vecmath-1.5.2.jar;. Main`

Again, In a UNIX-based system, you may need to change the ; to a :
